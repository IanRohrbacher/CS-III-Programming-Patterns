## Getting Started
> **IMPORTANT:**
> These files were created and run on a Linux server.

Most assignments are standard C++ source files. You can compile and run them manually using a C++ compiler (such as `g++`), for example:

```
g++ -o program main.cpp
./program
```

Many folders include a `Makefile` for convenience. If a Makefile is present, you can build the project by running:

```
make
```

This will produce the appropriate executable(s) as defined in the Makefile.
